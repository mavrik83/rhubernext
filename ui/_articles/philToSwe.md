## Introduction

I'm a philosopher, and I've always loved logic. It's the foundation of so much of what we do as human beings, as well as being a challenging and interesting subject in itself. Over the years I've looked for ways to apply my knowledge of logic to other things, including software engineering. In this article I'll explain how my love for philosophy led me into software engineering, and how it gave me an advantage over other programmers who didn't come from this background.

### Intro

Philosophy and software engineering might seem like a strange pair, but they're actually quite similar. In this article, I'll introduce you to both philosophy and software engineering, show how they're linked together, and tell you about my own journey through both fields.

Philosophy is the study of knowledge and reality: what can be known? What is real? How do we know these things?

Software engineering purports to be the application of science to create reliable software systems that are usable by their end-users. The emphasis here is on reliability, which means that we want our codebase(s) to not crash or otherwise malfunction when used under certain conditions (or in general). Additionally, we also want our codebase(s) to be easily modified as necessary—and only as necessary—so as not to break existing functionality for any users who depend on it being available in its present form or having access via some particular feature set provided by said system(s).

### My Story

I am a software engineer, and I love it. But before I became one, I studied philosophy. Why on earth would someone study philosophy and then become a software developer?

Why not? It's one of the most interesting fields of study out there - how can anyone resist studying things like logic, ethics and metaphysics? Not to mention all those famous people who were philosophers: Plato, Aristotle and Socrates. That's not even mentioning all the great works they created such as The Republic or The Metaphysics! Or even their ideas that have inspired so many other disciplines like psychology (Freud), economics (Adam Smith), politics (Machiavelli) and history (Hegel).

I've always been interested in how things work; how we understand ourselves; what makes us human beings different from animals/robotics etc.. These questions got me thinking about what does it mean for something to exist at all - is it even possible for us to know anything for sure about whether an object exists or not? What makes something real if we can't see it with our eyes or touch it with our hands?

### The Philosopher

Philosophy is the study of wisdom. Philosophy is a quest for truth, knowledge, meaning and the good life.

Philosophy is not just about what we should do or how we should live our lives—it is also about why we do what we do (and don't).

Why are there no good answers to any of these questions? Because people have been asking them for thousands of years without finding satisfactory answers! In fact, most philosophers just keep arguing with each other about what the answers should be until they get tired and give up trying!

### The Logician-Programmer

The logician-programmer is an individual with a strong foundation in logic. Logic is the foundation of programming, which means that the logician-programmer has a strong understanding of how to solve problems using logic.

Logic is also the foundation of philosophy, critical thinking and mathematics (and science and technology too).

We use logic every day. We think about what we want to do or accomplish; we use our imagination to envision what could be; then we plan how we will achieve those goals by breaking them down into smaller tasks/subgoals/subtasks…and so on. Each task or subgoal then has its own set of actions and steps needed to complete it successfully—the work required at each step can often be put into words: “If A occurs then B must happen next…then C after that happens!” Even something like playing checkers requires this kind of mental process when thinking through possible moves based on your opponent’s moves last turn as well as anticipating what he might do next turn based on his previous move(s) and current situation (with both players having only one piece left).

Philosophy is a good foundation for learning programming because it teaches you to think logically, which is the foundation of computer science. Philosophy also helps you understand how ideas relate to each other, which is vital when learning software engineering. In turn, software engineering can help you understand the purpose of a program and whether or not it will meet your needs. A solid knowledge of philosophy can help you succeed in computer science classes and eventually choose a career path within this industry.

### Conclusion

From philosophy I learnt to appreciate that the best foundation of knowledge is a solid understanding of logic.

You are probably wondering why I am telling you this. What does it have to do with software engineering?

Well, logic is the basis of software engineering and programming and critical thinking. And philosophy.

In fact, if you want to understand how to think like a programmer, then learning about logic is a great place to start.

It is not enough to just be a good programmer. Writing software is about communicating with computers and people, and in order to do that, you need to know what those people want from their computer systems. The problem with the example above is that it does not reflect the requirements of real-world users or the constraints of today’s technology. As a result, it cannot be implemented successfully without significant rework at some point down the line.
