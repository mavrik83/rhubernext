Many people, it seems, are very concerned about their jobs and careers with the release and rapid iterations of ChatGPT. Not mention the flurry money and projects using, expanding, or claiming to improve upon OpenAI's models. I'm not worried. At least not yet. AI has very long way to go before it can fully replace most knowledge workers.

Imagine a typical task in your workday. What is the context of that task? How many disparate 'things' do you need to keep present in you mind in order to perform it? How many abstract connections are you making? Does any of it require you to derive some kind of meaning? What about deriving meaning as it relates to someone else, or many someone elses?
