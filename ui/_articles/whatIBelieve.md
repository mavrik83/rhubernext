I believe that the most precious resource to humankind is our children.

I believe that the most valuable activity humans may undertake is the rearing and education of our children.

I believe that children owe nothing to their parents, neither in childhood nor adulthood. Rather, it is the parents that owe everything to their children. It is for the children that we toil and work, in the hope that their future is better than our present.

I believe that respect is earned not owed, especially as it relates to children and their parents.

I believe the mind of a child is a treasure. It must be nurtured and encouraged with curiosity and imagination, not encumbered with indoctrination. The mind of a child has no limits but the ones we impose on them.

I believe that, if given the proper tools, the mind of a child can be trusted to discern basic human morals; to discern right from wrong.
